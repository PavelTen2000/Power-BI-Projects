In this project I used Excel files and convered them to Power BI. 
Then I did data cleaning by removing files that were not necessary.
I then connected data model and made star schema, I connect transaction table to other lookup tables. 
I created DAX measures for Revunue and Quantity and implemented them to my visualization.
I showed revenue by markets and quantity by markets. Showed revenue trend. Revenue by custemors and products. Also added slicer for filtering year and month.
